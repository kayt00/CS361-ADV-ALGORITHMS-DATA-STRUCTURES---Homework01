# CS361-ADV-ALGORITHMS-DATA-STRUCTURES---Homework01

In this assignment I developed a calculator that tabulates a raw-score grade using a predefined weighted average. Our professor provided us with an input file that contained a formatted list of the grades (e.g. [Designation] [Grade]). The professor also provided us with a program that accepts two input parameters on the command line; the first being the name of the given input file and the second being the output file containing the tabulated raw-score grades. Our assignment was to implement the `Load` and `CalculateAverage` functions without a user-defined loop and no memory leaks.
